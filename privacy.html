            <p>
                At CodeUtility, we take your privacy seriously. Our tools are designed to run entirely in your browser, which means your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal data or the content you process using our tools.

            <h2>Data Processing</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> All our free tools run entirely in your web browser using JavaScript. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No data you enter into our tools is sent to our servers</li>
                <li>No files you upload are transmitted over the internet</li>
                <li>All processing happens locally on your device</li>
                <li>Your data never leaves your computer</li>
            </ul>

                We do not collect, store, or track any personal information or user data.</p>
            <p>
                We use Netlify Analytics to collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website, such as page views, browser type, and general location. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, and the data is used only to improve site performance and user experience.

            <h3>Server Logs</h3>
            <p>
                Our hosting provider (Netlify) may collect basic server logs for infrastructure purposes (e.g., IP addresses, timestamps). These logs are managed by Netlify according to their privacy policy and are not accessible to us for tracking purposes.

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
